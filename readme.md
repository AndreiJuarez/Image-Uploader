### Instructions to edit this proyect
In the case that you want to edit this project, first you need to install all the dependencies of node.js with the package.json, use the command:

`$ npm install`

Also you need to import the DB to MYSQL. I recomend use XAMPP in a local environment but you can use whatever DB Manager.

Edit the file with the name "server.js" that's the backend of all this project. In this file you can see all the settings to your DB.

There's some bugs that i need to fix but maybe you can do it more easy than my way.
